# Minifier Tools

**Tired of manually minifying your files?** Minifier Tools is a handy GitHub repository that provides you with three easy ways to minify your files locally and on demand!

## What it Does

Minifier Tools allows you to quickly reduce the size of your files. This can significantly improve website loading times and performance.

## Supported types

*   JavaScript
*   CSS
*   JSON
*   HTML
*   XML
*   SVG

## Features

There are two ways to use Minifier Tools:

*   **Post-build Minifier:** Perfect for integration with your build process. Simply add a script to your `package.json` to automatically minify your compiled JavaScript file after running `npm run build`. This script **WILL** overwrite your old JavaScript file.
*   **Standalone Minifier:** Drag your files to the `to_minify` folder. Run the script and voilÃ ! Your minified files will appear in the `minified` folder. No manual configuration needed!

**Important Notes:**

*   The post-build minifier currently only works with JavaScript files.
*   Standalone version will not overwrite existing files. Minified files will have a suffix of `-min.extension`.
*   All scripts automatically check for and install necessary tools (NodeJS, CleanCSS, UglifyJS) if they're missing.

## Getting Started

Head over to the GitHub repository to download Minifier Tools and get started by launching `minifier-tools.exe`

## How to Use It

**Post-build Minifier:**

1.  Update your `package.json` using the following format:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
		  "build": "tsc",
		  "postbuild": "bash ./path/to/script/postbuild_minifier.sh",
	  }
    ```
> `postbuild` will be automatically called after the successfull call of `build`

2.  Replace `FILE_NAME="C://PATH/TO/JS/SCRIPT/script.js"` with the actual path to your compiled JavaScript file.
3.  Everytime you run the `npm run build`, you will find your newly minified file under `$FILE_NAME-min.js`

**Standalone Minifier:**

1.  Drag your JS and CSS files to the `to_minify` folder.
2.  Run the script.
3.  Find your minified scripts in the `minified` folder.
