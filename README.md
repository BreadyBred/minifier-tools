# Minifier Tools

**Tired of manually minifying your files?** Minifier Tools is a handy GitHub repository that provides you with three easy ways to minify your files locally and on demand!

## What it Does

Minifier Tools allows you to quickly reduce the size of your files. This can significantly improve website loading times and performance.

## Supported types

*   JavaScript
*   CSS
*   JSON
*   HTML
*   XML
*   SVG

## Features

There are two ways to use Minifier Tools:

*   **Post-build Minifier:** Perfect for integration with your build process. Simply add a script to your `package.json` to automatically minify your compiled JavaScript file after running `npm run build`. This script **WILL** overwrite your old JavaScript file.
*   **Standalone Minifier:** Drag your files to the `to_minify` folder. Run the script and voilÃ ! Your minified files will appear in the `minified` folder. No manual configuration needed!

**Important Notes:**

*   The post-build minifier currently only works with JavaScript files.
*   Standalone version will not overwrite existing files. Minified files will have a suffix of `-min.extension`.
*   All scripts automatically check for and install necessary tools (NodeJS, CleanCSS, UglifyJS, etc...) if they're missing.

## Getting Started

Head over to the GitHub repository to download Minifier Tools and get started by launching `minifier-tools.exe`

## Prerequisites

**1. Python:**

Minifier Tools utilizes Python scripts for the EXE file. To use Minifier Tools, you'll either need Python installed on your system or a bash interpretor and your own coding skill to call directly the specific tool you need in your command prompt.

**How to Install Python:**

*   **Windows:** Download and install the latest Python version from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to check the "Add Python 3.x to PATH" option during installation.

*   **Mac/Linux:** Python might already be pre-installed on your system. Check by opening a terminal and running `python --version`. If not installed, download and install it from the [official website.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**2. Bash Interpreter (e.g., Git Bash):**

Minifier Tools utilizes Bash scripts for some functionalities. It's mandatory to have a Bash interpreter like Git Bash configured on your system for the minifier tools to work.

**How to Install Git Bash:**

*   Download the latest Git version from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) which includes Git Bash for Windows.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> During installation, make sure to select the option to "Use Git from the Windows command prompt" and "Add Git Bash to your PATH".

## How to Use It

**Post-build Minifier:**

1.  Update your `package.json` using the following format:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
		  "build": "tsc",
		  "postbuild": "bash ./path/to/script/postbuild_minifier.sh",
	  }
    ```
> `postbuild` will be automatically called after the successfull call of `build`

2.  Replace `FILE_NAME="C://PATH/TO/JS/SCRIPT/script.js"` with the actual path to your compiled JavaScript file.
3.  Everytime you run the `npm run build`, you will find your newly minified file under `$FILE_NAME-min.js`

**Standalone Minifier:**

1.  Drag your files to the `to_minify` folder.
2.  Run the script.
3.  Find your minified scripts in the `minified` folder.
